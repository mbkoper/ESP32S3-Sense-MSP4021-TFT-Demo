; If you have a different board (e.g., seeed_xiao_esp32s3), replace board above with the correct PlatformIO board id.
; macOS M4 compatibility: PlatformIO and the toolchain are universal; the build runs under PlatformIO's toolchain.

; Libraries referenced by name; PlatformIO will resolve them automatically when building.

; Extra build flags can be added here if needed:

  ; Enable extra debug output if desired:
  -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=5

; If you need to override linker or camera component options for esp32-camera, we can add extra flags here.
; If your camera or board requires additional components not provided by Arduino core, we'll add them once you confirm.
